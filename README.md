# üåê Unified Word Explorer

A comprehensive dashboard for deep linguistic analysis. This tool goes beyond a simple dictionary, offering a multi-faceted exploration of words by integrating data from various lexical, semantic, and knowledge-based sources, augmented with AI-powered insights from Google Gemini.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Word of the Day**: Greets users with a randomly selected, interesting word upon loading to encourage discovery.
- **Morphology Explorer**: Generates and analyzes prefixed and suffixed variations of a root word.
- **Semantic Relationships**: Fetches and displays semantic connections (e.g., `IsA`, `UsedFor`) from ConceptNet.
- **Word Associations**: Finds and displays words that are strongly associated with the root term.
- **Wikipedia Subtopics**: Pulls the table of contents from a word's Wikipedia article to provide structured knowledge.
- **Lexical Relationships**: Provides synonyms, antonyms, and hypernyms (broader concepts) from multiple sources (DictionaryAPI, WordNet/Datamuse).
- **Etymology & Origin**: Displays the historical origin of a word.
- **Unified Word Tree**: An interactive, text-based visualization that aggregates all data sources into a single, hierarchical view. Nodes are clickable to reveal more details.
- **Word Influence Meter**: A heuristic-based tool to score a word's "influence" based on intensity, polarity, frequency, and persuasiveness.
- **Conceptual Blender**: A creative tool that combines semantic properties of two different concepts to spark new ideas.
- **Search History**: Keeps track of your recent searches.
- **Data Export**: Allows users to download the complete results of an exploration as a structured `JSON` or a human-readable `Markdown` file.
- **Gemini-Powered Analysis**: On-demand AI analysis within relevant panels to summarize patterns, elaborate on etymology, and provide deeper insights.
- **Gemini Chatbot**: An integrated conversational AI to answer any related (or unrelated) questions.
- **Gemini "Thinking Mode"**: A dedicated mode for complex queries that leverages a more powerful model with an extended reasoning budget.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run

While this app is designed for a specific web-based development environment, you can run a similar project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3.  **Set up environment variables**: Create a `.env` file and add your `API_KEY` for the Google Gemini API.
4.  **Run the development server**: `npm start`
