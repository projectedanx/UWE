# üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction and long-term goals for the Unified Word Explorer.

## Mission

To create the most insightful and intuitive tool for linguistic exploration, blending structured data with the creative power of generative AI to help writers, researchers, and the curious deepen their understanding of language.

### ‚úÖ **Recently Completed**

-   **[Data Export]**
    -   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete**
    -   **Goal:** Allow users to export their findings.
    -   **Implementation:** Export functionality for JSON and Markdown formats is live. This enables users to save and use the data in their own notes, research, or other applications.
-   **[Comparative Analysis]**
    -   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete**
    -   **Goal:** A dedicated mode to compare two words across all available metrics, with a Gemini-generated summary of their key differences and similarities.
    -   **Implementation:** The "Comparative Analysis" panel is now integrated, allowing users to input two words and receive a Gemini-powered comparison of their morphology, lexical fields, semantic relationships, and etymology.

### **Q3 2024: Enhanced Interactivity & Visualization**

-   **[Interactive Graph Visualization]**
    -   **Goal:** Replace the current interactive text-based tree with a dynamic, force-directed graph (using D3.js or a similar library).
    -   **Features:** Nodes will be clickable, expandable, and color-coded. Users can pan, zoom, and isolate different branches of the data for a more fluid and visually engaging exploration.

### **Q4 2024: Deeper Linguistic Analysis & Personalization**

-   **[Usage Examples & Collocations]**
    -   **Goal:** Integrate an API (like the Collins API) to pull real-world sentence examples for a given word.
    -   **Features:** Show common collocations (words that frequently appear together) to provide contextual understanding.

-   **[User Accounts & Saved Sessions]**
    -   **Goal:** Allow users to save and revisit their exploration sessions.
    -   **Features:** Basic user authentication and the ability to save a "snapshot" of a searched word and all its related data.

### **Future / Long-Term Vision**

-   **[Advanced Gemini Integration]**
    -   **Goal:** Move beyond summarization to more complex AI tasks.
    -   **Ideas:**
        -   **Creative Writing Assistant:** Use Gemini to generate poetry, prose, or metaphors based on the explored data.

-   **[Multilingual Support]**
    -   **Goal:** Extend the explorer's capabilities beyond English.
    -   **Implementation:** Adapt API calls and UI to handle different languages, starting with commonly requested ones like Spanish, French, or German.

-   **[Customizable Dashboard]**
    -   **Goal:** Give users control over their workspace.
    -   **Features:** Allow users to drag, drop, resize, and hide panels to create a layout that suits their workflow.

-   **[Shareable Session URLs]**
    -   **Goal:** Allow users to share their findings with others.
    -   **Implementation:** Generate a unique URL that saves the state of a search, enabling collaboration and easy sharing of linguistic discoveries.
